# Coursera_datacleaning_assignment
Coursera final assignment from "Getting and Cleaning Data"

Data was downloaded from this site:  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

Further information on the dataset can be found here:

The R script in this project should do the following: 

1) Merge the training and the test set to create one data set.
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The Rscript can be run if the working directory is set to the downloaded data (see above) and produces a csv file called "tidy_dataset.csv"
